## Submitting contributions

Before opening a pull request (or submitting a contribution) you will need to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before making a submission, [learn more here](https://carto.com/contributing).

After that, there are several rules you should follow when a new pull request is created:

- Title has to be descriptive. If you are fixing a bug don't use the ticket title or number.
- Explain what you have achieved in the description and choose a reviewer (it has to be a CARTO team member) of your code. If you have doubts, just ask for one.
